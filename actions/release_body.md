A small deck in Anki's .apkg format to show of the template and streamline the setup for inexperienced users.

To import this deck into your Anki collection simply download the .apkg file and open your Anki application. Under File click `Import...`, navigate to your downloaded file's location, select it and confirm. Anki will now import the new deck under the name PrettyYomitanCardsDemo.
When it is done you can open a card of the deck in the card browser and confirm if everything is working correctly in the preview.

You can now reuse the *PrettyYomitan* note type to generate your own flashcards with the template and the Yomitan browser extension.

If you are following the setup tutorial return to the [Configure Yomitan](https://github.com/99-Knots/PrettyYomitanCards?tab=readme-ov-file#configuring-yomitan) section and continue the instructions from there.
