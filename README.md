# PrettyYomitanCards
Trying to provide a visually pleasing and highly functional Anki card format that easily integrates with the Yomitan browser extension

[Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJxndUGN8Cg) for installing Yomichan and connecting it with Anki.  
You can follow this tutorial up to 4:00 but when creating a new note type create and name your fields according to the scheme in [AnkiFields.png](../main/AnkiFields.png).  
To enable Yomichan for local files as well, go to your browser's extension settings page (chrome://extensions when using Chrome), find Yomichan there and enable 'allow access to file URLs' for it.
